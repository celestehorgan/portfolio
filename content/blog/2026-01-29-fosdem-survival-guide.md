The first time I attended FOSDEM, I had no idea what to expect. At 3 years of attenance, no organizing a devroom (but I'd love to do it next year!) and no speaking (another would-love-to-do!), I would hardly call myself a veteran. That said, this post is a series of tips and tricks to help you make the most of your first FOSDEM.


# Pack 

It's a weekend in a large European city. Anything you forget you can easily find in the local shops or malls, but here's how I usually approach things: 

- **Comfortable shoes that are water resistant/waterproof**
- **A good coat, ideally nothing too long**
- **A small/medium sized backpack** 
- **A hat and a scarf**
- **Layers**

As always, bring the travel pharmacy: 
- **Your favorite muscle releif/painkiller (I like ibuprofen)**
- **Joint support: athletic tape, knee/ankle braces, etc**
- **Deodorant:** I'm begging you. 

And finally, because I'm in DevRel
- **Stickers**
- **A camera** 

# Get in 

Brussels is a well connected city. In general, if you can arrive via train (Eurostar or regional), it's a bit easier to get where you're going.

ULB Solbosch is fairly removed from the city center, and Airbnbs near the university sell out well in advance of the weekend each year. Most hotels are located about 20 minutes away by local transport links from the university in the city center. This also happens to be where all the food and drink are, which we'll discuss later. 

Staying near Brussel-Centraal is useful for transit links, but all of central Brussels is fairly walkable. Generally you want to stay west of Parc de Bruxelles if being in walking distance of friends and other attendees is a priority for you. 

**2026: there is a train strike happening FOSDEM weekend:** https://www.brusselstimes.com/1927839/everything-we-know-so-far-about-belgiums-railway-strike-next-week. It's unknown if Eurostar or trains from France/NL/DE are affected as of now, but be aware if you're coming from the airport!

If driving, note that Brussels requires registration to drive in the low emissions zone in the city center: https://www.lez.brussels/mytax/

# Prepare

The day I arrive in Brussels, I like to take some time to hit a grocery store. ULB Solbosch is primarily surrunded by residential buildings, and there are no grocery stores in walking distance. Most on-campus food and drink services are closed for the weekend, with the exception of a couple of cafes that get severely slammed.

- **6x 0.75L bottles of water:** I bring one in a backpack with me each day, and I usually drink a full one in my hotel room when I get back at night. ULB Solbosch is _crowded_, and finding somewhere to refill a water bottle is challenging. 
- **A variety of protein bars, granola bars and other backpack snacks:** While the FOSDEM crew makes an effort to bring in food carts to the campus for the weekend, you'll often find yourself in a long line. I bring 2-3 granola bars each day. Sometimes I end up giving them to people desperate for a bit of food. 
- **A few sandwiches, if I have a minifridge in my hotel room:** Similar to above: I like to remove the dependency on the food trucks for my main meal if I can.
