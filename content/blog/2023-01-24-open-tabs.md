I didn't do nearly as much writing as I intended to last year: suffice to say, [things got a little tumultuous](https://www.linkedin.com/in/celeste-horgan-b65b5a1a/).

After [chatting with a colleague](https://twitter.com/OlenaKutsenko) at my new job, however, I realize that there was a far lower barrier way to do this: write about what I'm reading currently. 

And thus (hopefully) begins Open Tabs, a series where I catalog my Open Tabs in a casual, easy way (and maybe close some tabs in the process?)

## Events

[Write the Docs 2023](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2023/)'s CFP closes February 6, 2023. Naturally, I have the Google Doc with my submission draft open.

[Open Source Summit North America 2023](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) also closes soon, on February 5th. For this one I'm still staring at an empty doc.

## Learning 

I'm writing something on observability and open telemetry for work, and as a result I'm making sure I know enough _about_ observability to do the topic justice. I have a number of tabs open:

- [charity.wtf tag: "Observability"](https://charity.wtf/tag/observability/) as a casual start,
- [Cindy Sridharan (@copyconstruct) on Medium](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/) wrote a number of posts on the topic from 2016-2019 or so. 

I'm also now at [a database as a service company](https://aiven.io) and need to make sure I know enough about databases in general, and streaming data in specific. 

I've got [Use the index, Luke!](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/preface) open to brush up on my SQL, and we'll go from there I guess? 

For a mentorship meeting earlier this week, I once again pulled up Mary Thengvall's [Developer Relations career path](https://www.marythengvall.com/blog/2020/6/29/the-camunda-developer-relations-career-path) and Sarah Drasner's [Career Ladders](https://career-ladders.dev/).

## Tools 

[Aiven Console](https://console.aiven.io/login), naturally, to look at Aiven projects and services for work.

[TinyIMG](https://tiny-img.com/) is an easy to use image optimizer. We use it to reduce the file size of images for the [Aiven Blog](https://blog.aiven.io). It freaks me out a little though (What if I upload something confidential to.. some random server, somewhere?)

[Slackmoji](https://slackmojis.com/), because sometimes the right emoji can soften the blow of nagging people to do things.

[Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/), because who _isn't_ keeping an eye on things right now :(

## For fun 

[Indie darling Beirut launched a new album](https://www.beirutband.com/), _Artifacts_, which is part re-recording and part Greatest Hits. I'm now contemplating whether to drop 125€‎ on vinyl.

[How to maintain restored Mid-century modern teak, walnut and rosewood furniture](https://midcenturymoderntoronto.com/blogs/about-mid-century-modern-furniture/how-to-maintain-restored-mid-century-modern-teak-walnut-and-rosewood-furniture). I recently picked up a vintage teak coffee table for a steal of a price, but it has some lightening due to sun exposure. If anyone has a good guide to restoring oiled teak finishes, hit me up on social media. I have [a few more](https://www.teakculture.com/pages/teak-care) [tabs open](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/William-Cook/dp/0754829170/) on the topic. 

## Spotify playlist of the moment 

[In The K-Indie](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXdTb8AG95jne?si=ab7709038d394351). The Korean Indie scene is a bit hard to access from the west, but it's really worth the effort.
