description ="""I currently work at the Linux Foundation as a Staff Technical Writer on 
Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects.

I write documentation, design/develop project websites, mentor projects on documentation best practices, 
and run [Techdocs Office Hours](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs#office-hours). 
The "staff" part of my job entails process and systems-thinking: so far I've
scoped the [services we offer projects](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs/blob/main/services.md), 
and scaled our team using [docs assessments](https://github.com/cncf/techdocs/tree/main/assessments).
