Nothing you do matters unless people are involved. But the most important part of creating open source communities is your mindset as a maintainer and leader: understanding why community building, contributor on-ramping, and communication sets the stage for project success. This talk, delivered by seasoned CNCF open source community members Kat Cosgrove and Celeste Horgan, goes over actionable ways to attract and build a robust, active developer community around your open source project, and the mindset you need to develop to do so."""

This talk, delivered by one of CNCF’s full-time technical writers, will teach you how to approach writing for developers. 
We’ll go over deciding what to write, thinking about documentation from a user’s perspective, and what makes great writing.
 We’ll walk through improving an existing page of documentation on an actual CNCF project, as well as how to draft new feature 
 documentation from scratch. This talk is aimed at developers who would like to write better, 
 and folks considering a career switch into technical writing."""
